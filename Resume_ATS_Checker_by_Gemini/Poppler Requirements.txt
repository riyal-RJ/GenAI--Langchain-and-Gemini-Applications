Windows
Windows users will have to build or download poppler for Windows. I recommend @oschwartz10612 version which is the most up-to-date. You will then have to add the bin/ folder to PATH or use poppler_path = r"C:\path\to\poppler-xx\bin" as an argument in convert_from_path.

Mac
Mac users will have to install poppler.

Installing using Brew:

brew install poppler
Linux
Most distros ship with pdftoppm and pdftocairo. If they are not installed, refer to your package manager to install poppler-utils

Platform-independant (Using conda)
Install poppler: conda install -c conda-forge poppler
Install pdf2image: pip install pdf2image
